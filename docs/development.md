# Development Lifecycle

## Trunk Based Development

![Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/trunk1b.png)

The giga-data-ingestion project follows the concept of Trunk-based Development,
wherein User Stories are worked on PRs. PRs then get merged to `main` once approved by
the team.

The main branch serves as the most up-to-date version of the code base.

### Naming Format

**Branch Names:**

Refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

**PR Title:** `[<Feature/Fix/Release/Hotfix>](<issue-id>) <Short desc>`

**PR Template:** [pull_request_template.md](../.github/pull_request_template.md)

### Development Workflow

- Branch off from `main` to ensure you get the latest code.
- Name your branch according to the Naming Conventions.
- Keep your commits self-contained and your PRs small and tailored to a specific feature
  as much as possible.
- Push your commits, open a PR and fill in the PR template.
- Request a review from 1 other developer.
- Once approved, rebase/squash your commits into `main`.
